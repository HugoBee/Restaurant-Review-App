## Overview
This is project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. A static broken code was given to us to fix. Using our new found skills we have to include accessbility features, a service worker for offline viewing, and maintain all of its current functionality.

## Stage One
This part of the project focuses on the application to be
- Accesible
- Have Data offline
- Mobile Responsive Ready

## Resources
* Udacity's starter code
* Mapbox token



## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
