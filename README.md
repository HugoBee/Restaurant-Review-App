## Overview
This is project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. A static broken code was given to us to fix. Using our new found skills we have to include accessbility features, a service worker for offline viewing, and maintain all of its current functionality.

## Stage One
This part of the project focuses on the application to be
- Accesible
- Have Data offline
- Mobile Responsive Ready

## To Run Locally you will need a http server running I suggest you use Python

1. Open the root folder of the repository in a terminal
2. Run `npm i`
3. Check your python version by `python -V`
4. Start local server:
	- For Python 2.x: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
	- For Python 3.x: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
6. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Resources
* Udacity's starter code
* Mapbox token



## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
